DOSBox-X Manual (always use the latest version from www.dosbox-x.com)

DOSBox-X is a fork of the original DOSBox project (www.dosbox.com)




I am rewriting this README, and new information will be added over time --J.C.



How to compile DOSBox-X in Ubuntu (kapper1224)
----------------------------------------------

sudo apt install libavformat-* libswscale-* libavcodec-*
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install



How to compile in general
-------------------------

General Linux compile (FFMPEG/libav support required)
./build-debug


General Linux compile if FFMPEG/libav not desired
./build-debug-no-avcodec


MinGW compile (on Windows) for 32-bit Windows XP
./build-mingw


MinGW compile (on Windows) for 32-bit Windows XP, lower-end systems that lack MMX/SSE
./build-mingw-lowend


MinGW compile (on Windows) to target MS-DOS and the HX DOS extender
./build-mingw-hx-dos


Visual Studio 2017 compile for 32/64-bit Windows Vista or higher
Use the ./vs2015/dosbox-x.sln "solution" file and compile.
You will need the DirectX 2010 SDK for Direct3D9 support.


XCode (on Mac OS X, from the Terminal) to target Mac OS X
./build-debug


Open source development
-----------------------

Ideas and patches are always welcome, though not necessarily accepted.

If you really need that feature or change, and your changes are not
accepted into this main project (or you just want to mess around with
the code), feel free to fork this project and make your changes in
your fork.
