VGA BUG: Color palette error, last color of the palette, usually if it's white,
         instead usually comes out black.

 - Surprise! productions, The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
     - Happens at the demo part with the gargoyle demon art thing that warps
       vertially: the failure appears as black splotches on his wings that SHOULD
       be white.


VGA BUG: Exotic VRAM clearing tricks do not work, leaving "garbage" on the screen

 - Surprise! productions, The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
     - There are two parts with rotating wireframe meshes that make use of VGA
       palette trickry to create "motion blur". Failure to clear the screen results
       in a wireframe mesh with a border of garbage pixels that flicker.

 - Optic Nerve (demo)
     - At the start of each demo part, when displaying the title of that part, the
       demo fails to clear the screen. Result: demo title with contents of the
       previous screen or title screen around it, garbled due to palette mismatch.

 - Abaddon: Cycling!
     - Failure to clear the screen is visible when the VGA split-screen pans upward.
       The "loading" graphic and other garbage contents are visible below the
       animated VU meters where on real hardware that part of the screen would be
       blank.
