Revised "SDL" code, combined SDL1 and SDL2 reimplementation, known as SDL1half until a better name can be given.

- Full C++ implementation, rather than SDL-style plain C
- C++ object for a window
- C++ object for a surface
- Surface attachment to a window
- Surface attachment to a region on a window
- Multiple surfaces can be attached to a window, overlapping allowed
- Windows can be directed to go fullscreen (which locks out other windows)
- Library will indicate if environment cannot support multiple windows (i.e. fullscreen, or framebuffer display without windowing system)
- Surface updates can be queued to a window at a frame rate

- Surface format implementation:
  - First: 32-bit 8-bit RGBA (or ARGB or BGRA, etc) with or without alpha channel
  - Second: 16-bit 5:6:5 RGB or BGR or 5:5:5 XRGB or XBGR
  - Third: 32-bit 10-bit RGBA (or ARGB, etc) without alpha channel
