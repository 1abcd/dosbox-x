This lays out the improvements to the previous CMake build.

 - it has been splitted as many lists, much easier to maintain and read
 - uses vcpkg for Windows, dependencies are fetched with ```vcpkg install fluidsynth libpng pdcurses sdl2 zlib```
 - nearly all config.h options are now presented in the CMake GUI (help wanted)
 
Caveats

 - linux compatibility is commented out for the time being
 - SDL2-only build
