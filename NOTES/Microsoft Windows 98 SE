* When installing Windows 98 or 98SE in DOSBox:

  Use core=dynamic for a faster install.

  Turn OFF the "non-recursive page fault" option during
  the install phase. Leaving it on guarantees that DOSBox
  (with core=dynamic) will segfault after the 2nd reboot.
  I have no idea at this time what the segfault is about.
  You can turn the non-recursive page fault back on later.
