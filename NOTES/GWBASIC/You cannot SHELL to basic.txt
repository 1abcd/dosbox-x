One persistent issue in any MS-DOS HDD image I generate is that
I can never get BASIC.COM, BASICA.COM, and GWBASIC.EXE to run.

Even from the command line, it will always print "You cannot SHELL to basic".

It turns out from some investigation that BASIC/GWBASIC uses the byte
value at 0000:050F as a flag whether or not it is currently running.

If the flag value is nonzero, GWBASIC thinks it's already running and
prints the error message.

Problem is that for some reason, there is junk at 0000:0500-0000:05FF
that looks like the remnants of a directory listing, when booting
my disk images.

DOSBox-X does not write those byte values, which is why the same
executable runs just fine under the DOSBox-X DOS kernel.

If GWBASIC refuses to run when clearly it is not already running,
break into the debugger and type:

SM 0:50F 0

and hit enter. Resume emulation and BASIC/GWBASIC should then
run without complaint.
