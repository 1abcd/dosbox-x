The most likely reason Windows ME setup will crash in DOSBox-X
is that the Setup program wants to initialize the shell and
system configuration on startup. It will always crash (so far).

One way around that is to boot into Safe Mode, wait for the
shell to appear, and then pull up RegEdit.

Locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
key, then look for the string value InitShell. Delete the string value. Reboot.
