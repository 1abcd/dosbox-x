Apparently it's possible to install Windows NT 3.1 in DOSBox and get it to run!
Here's how:

1. Edit your dosbox.conf and make sure you have these settings:

[dos]
biosps2=true

[keyboard]
aux=true

Windows NT 3.1 will not detect the AUX port if it does not see the
BIOS reporting via INT 15h, apparently. The AUX port must be enabled.
And finally, because the NT 3.1 AUX driver does not carry out the
full PS/2 device initialization properly, you need DOSBox to default
to streaming mode when reporting is enabled. NT 3.1 apparently does
not send the command to enable streaming (leaves it in reporting
mode).

2. Install MS-DOS 6.22 first.

3. Use MS-DOS to run the NT installer.

4. Shutdown DOSBox-X

5. Go into src/cpu/cpu.cpp and modify the top as follows:

#define CPU_CHECK_EXCEPT 1
// #define CPU_CHECK_IGNORE 1

   The NT kernel apparently requires exception handling to work properly
   before it will boot in DOSBox.

6. Startup DOSBox-X and let NT boot. It should make it to the graphical
   desktop.
