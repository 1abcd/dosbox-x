Apparently it's possible to install Windows NT 3.1 in DOSBox and get it to run!
Here's how:

1. Install MS-DOS 6.22 first.

2. Use MS-DOS to run the NT installer.

3. Shutdown DOSBox-X

4. Go into src/cpu/cpu.cpp and modify the top as follows:

#define CPU_CHECK_EXCEPT 1
// #define CPU_CHECK_IGNORE 1

   The NT kernel apparently requires exception handling to work properly
   before it will boot in DOSBox.

5. Startup DOSBox-X and let NT boot. It should make it to the graphical
   desktop.

BUGS:

 - Boot-screen seems to pause for an unnecessarily long amount of time,
   unless you hit a key, which apparently breaks it out of whatever it
   was waiting for.
