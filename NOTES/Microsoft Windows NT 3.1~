Apparently it's possible to install Windows NT 3.1 in DOSBox and get it to run!
Here's how:

1. Install MS-DOS 6.22 first.

2. Use MS-DOS to run the NT installer.

3. Shutdown DOSBox-X

4. Go into src/cpu/cpu.cpp and modify the top as follows:

#define CPU_CHECK_EXCEPT 1
// #define CPU_CHECK_IGNORE 1

   The NT kernel apparently requires exception handling to work properly
   before it will boot in DOSBox.

5. Startup DOSBox-X and let NT boot. It should make it to the graphical
   desktop.

   NOTE: As of 2014/04/13 do NOT use or move the mouse! There is an incompatibility
         of some kind between mouse emulation and NT that causes NT to crash.
