DOSBox-X is not compatible with keyboard layouts it's not prepared for.

The SDL1 library used in this source tree, unlike the official library,
does not attempt to hack around the issue by forcing Windows to load
the US keyboard layout for itself.

This document serves as a guide to begin modifying the source code in
this project to add support for your keyboard layout.

VK_* mapping in SDL1 (Windows):
- vs2015/sdl/src/video/windib/SDL_dibevents.c: DIB_InitOSKeymapPriv()

DOSBox-X keyboard layout enum:
- include/keymap.h (DKM_*) constants
- src/gui/sdlmain.cpp KeyboardLayoutDetect(), DKM_to_string(), DKM_to_descriptive_string()
- src/gui/sdlmain_linux.cpp (if working on Linux)

You may want to familiarize yourself with the Windows LCID for the locale
you'd like to add, as well as the VK_* scan codes generated by the keyboard
for that locale, so that SDL1 mapping can be updated properly.

In Linux, you may want to examine the X11 server keymap table and mod map
table and look at the X11 codes visible in the mapper to determine how
to add support.
