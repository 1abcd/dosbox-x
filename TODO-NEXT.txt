Plans for next modifications to DOSBox:

- Cleanup "new" allocator memory leaks visible in IDE and other
  DOSBox INIT functions. Probably another case of not freeing
  the "test" object

- Add option to dosbox.conf to allow enabling/disabling INT 13h
  extensions (AH=0x40 through AH=0x48).

- El Torito bootable CD-ROM emulation. Someone on the forums
  wants to run ReactOS in DOSBox and booting from CD seems to
  be the only way to install ReactOS.
