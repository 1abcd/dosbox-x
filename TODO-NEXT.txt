Plans for next modifications to DOSBox:

- Cleanup "new" allocator memory leaks visible in IDE and other
  DOSBox INIT functions. Probably another case of not freeing
  the "test" object

- El Torito bootable CD-ROM emulation. Someone on the forums
  wants to run ReactOS in DOSBox and booting from CD seems to
  be the only way to install ReactOS. Booting "floppy" and
  "no emulation" modes are the highest priority.

- Begin working on floppy controller emulation (Intel 8272A/NEC uPD765
  controller emulation). Make it an option in dosbox.conf whether
  or not I/O port emulation is enabled. Make sure that it coexists
  with INT 13h emulation of the floppy drive. If the emulation is
  successful, Win95 will be able to talk to it directly without
  "MS-DOS compatability mode enabled for Drive A:" and Windows NT
  will be able to use the floppy drive. Make sure the emulation
  can correctly emulate both 3.5" and 5.25" floppy drives and
  all common formats (360KB/720KB/1.2MB/1.44MB) including single
  density and double density.
