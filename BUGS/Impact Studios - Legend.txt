Impact Studio - Legends

BUG: Demo timing runs at half speed, eventually malfunctions and gets
     stuck in the double-lens section of the demo.

If you run the demo and the bouncing ball and rotozoomer sections run
slowly, then you are seeing the bug in effect and you should consider
exiting out because the demo will glitch at the lens section and
never progress past it.

 - It's not a PIT issue, I tried hacking the PIT to halve the interval.
   All that does is cause the music to play twice as fast but has no
   effect on the frame rate.

 - So what IS the demo using for a timer source then? The RTC?

 - I remember this bug first showing up in DOSBox 0.74, previous
   versions of DOSBox (0.72) ran the demo perfectly fine, which is
   how I was able to do the demoscene capture for the demoscene
   collection DVD on scene.org. So what did previous versions of
   DOSBox do right that DOSBox 0.74 (and therefore DOSBox-X) does
   wrong?
