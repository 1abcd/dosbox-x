VGA BUG: Color palette error, last color of the palette, usually if it's white,
         instead usually comes out black.

 - Surprise! productions, The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
     - Happens at the demo part with the gargoyle demon art thing that warps
       vertially: the failure appears as black splotches on his wings that SHOULD
       be white.


VGA BUG: Exotic VRAM clearing tricks do not work, leaving "garbage" on the screen

 - Surprise! productions, The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
     - There are two parts with rotating wireframe meshes that make use of VGA
       palette trickry to create "motion blur". Failure to clear the screen results
       in a wireframe mesh with a border of garbage pixels that flicker.

 - Optic Nerve (demo)
     - At the start of each demo part, when displaying the title of that part, the
       demo fails to clear the screen. Result: demo title with contents of the
       previous screen or title screen around it, garbled due to palette mismatch.

 - Abaddon: Cycling!
     - Failure to clear the screen is visible when the VGA split-screen pans upward.
       The "loading" graphic and other garbage contents are visible below the
       animated VU meters where on real hardware that part of the screen would be
       blank.

VGA BUG: Failure to save and restore VGA text screen contents

 - Microsoft Windows 95 boot logo
     - Windows 95 is able to show the boot logo, but when restoring the VGA text
       console, the contents are all messed up. Why?

 - Microsoft Windows 3.0/3.1/95/98
     - Running the DOS prompt in a window works, until you move the mouse cursor
       over or near the DOS window. If you go back to fullscreen, the extended
       character set is missing. If you go back and forth 2 or more times, the
       character font is missing entirely.
     - If any DOS program writes to the screen the contents appear as garbage at
       the top of the Windows desktop. Whatever normally prevents the DOS program
       from affecting the screen by Windows is not triggering in DOSBox and it
       may be the source of corrupted VGA states.
     - Weird crashes when you move the mouse cursor over the window do NOT happen
       in Windows 3.11 Windows for Workgroups if 32-bit disk and file access is
       enabled.

VGA BUG: Switching to the DOSBox keymapper, then back, results in failure to redraw
         emulated VGA output.

VGA BUG: Active display area cuts off right margin for Do Whacka Do

 - Do Whacka Do works perfectly except that the rightmost 8-10 pixels are cut off,
   which makes it a bit difficult to read the scroller at the bottom of the screen.
