Microsoft Windows Millenium Edition

System reboot doesn't work with DOSBox:
 - I think it has to do with the fact that the keyboard controller
   emulation correctly emulates the A20 gate for the output port
   but not the reset line. Perhaps Windows 95/98 happens to work
   because they also try port 0x92, while Windows ME for some reason
   doesn't try port 0x92.
