Magic 12 - Show bug report

VGA raster bugs:
 - 18-bit RGB highcolor hacked modes work except for minor errors
   in linewise rendering that cause visible "stripes" in the output
   (but only if the cycles count is greater than about 9000).

Memory corruption bugs:
 - DOSBox complains upon demo exit that the MCB (memory allocation
   chain) is corrupted IF "private area in umb=false" and
   "private area size=4096", or "private area in umb=false"
   and "mainline compatible mapping=false" and "private area size"
   is less than 32768.
