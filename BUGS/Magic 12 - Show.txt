Magic 12 - Show bug report

VGA raster bugs:
 - 18-bit RGB highcolor hacked modes work except for minor errors
   in linewise rendering that cause visible "stripes" in the output
   (but only if the cycles count is greater than about 9000).

Memory corruption bugs:
 - Majic 12 appears to have issues with upper memory blocks or anything
   in the upper (0xC000-0xCFFF) range. If you run the demo with umb=true
   or with the private data area in umb, the contents stored up there
   will be partially or fully zeroed by the demo on shutdown. Worst
   case scenario the overwritten data will cause DOSBox to crash with
   an error message stating that the MCBs (Memory Control Block linked
   list used to manage DOS memory allocations) is corrupt.

   A dump of the MCB list in that case shows MCBs in lower memory
   (below 640KB) are intact while the MCB chain in upper memory is
   completely gone!
