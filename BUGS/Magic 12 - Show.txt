Magic 12 - Show bug report

VGA raster bugs:
 - 18-bit RGB highcolor hacked modes work except for minor errors
   in linewise rendering that cause visible "stripes" in the output
   (but only if the cycles count is greater than about 9000).

Memory corruption bugs:
 - If UMBs are enabled, Majic 12 will cause an "MCB list corrupted"
   message after the demo has run, when you run certain other programs
   like MEM.COM. Apparently Majic 12 overwrites 2 bytes in the
   last MCB below 640KB at segment 0x9FFF sometime during the demo.
   The 2 bytes written happen to stomp on the upper 8 bits of some
   other field and the lower 8 bits of the segment size field. Once
   the segment size is corrupted, the MCB no longer points to the
   first block in UMB, and DOSBox detects this as an "MCB list
   corrupted" error.
